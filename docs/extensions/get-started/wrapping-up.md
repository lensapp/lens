# Wrapping Up

In [Your First Extension](your-first-extension.md), you learned how to create and run an extension.
In [Extension Anatomy](anatomy.md), you learned in detail how a basic extension works.
This is just a glimpse into what can be created with Lens extensions.
Below are some suggested routes for learning more.

## Extension Capabilities

In this section, you'll find information on common extension capabilities, styling information, and a color reference guide.
Determine whether your idea for an extension is doable and get ideas for new extensions by reading through the [Common Capabilities](../capabilities/common-capabilities.md) page.

## Guides and Samples

Here you'll find a collection of sample extensions that you can use as a base to work from.
Some of these samples include a detailed guide that explains the source code.
You can find all samples and guides in the [lens-extension-samples](https://github.com/lensapp/lens-extension-samples) repository.

## Testing and Publishing

In this section, you can learn:

* How to add [integration tests](../testing-and-publishing/testing.md) to your extension
* How to [publish your extension](../testing-and-publishing/publishing.md)
