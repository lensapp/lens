Make sure you have Node.js and Git installed.... Installing and Building the extension # Simple Lens extension that adds \"Hello World\" page to a cluster menu.

After this initial restart you can reload Lens and it will pick up any new builds of the extension. Within Lens connect to an existing cluster or create a new one .
